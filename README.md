# Psychophysics Experiment on Rapid Categorization

## Overview
This project investigates human perception and confidence in rapid visual categorization tasks. A psychophysics experiment was designed and implemented using **Psychtoolbox** in **MATLAB**, where participants classified briefly presented images as human or non-human. The study analyzed behavioral data, including accuracy, response times, and confidence levels, and compared human performance with computational modeling.

## Features
- **Visual Categorization Task**: Developed using **Psychtoolbox** in **MATLAB**.
- **Behavioral Data Analysis**: Examined accuracy, response times, and confidence levels.
- **Inter-Subject Comparison**: Investigated the relationship between classification accuracy and confidence.
- **Computational Modeling**: Simulated human perception using the **HMAX** model.
- **Machine Learning & Regression**: Applied **linear regression** and **machine learning** techniques to compare model performance with human data.

## Methods
